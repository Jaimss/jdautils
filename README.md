#### Language Support
jdautils is written in kotlin, and utilizes Kotlin's [extension functions](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/extensions.html) which makes things very easy and quick to do. It adds methods onto things like `MessageChannel` and `MessageAction` to make for awesome oneliners like `someChannel.send("message").cleanup()`. When using java, extension functions can be used as static reciever methods. Please see the wiki for more information on how to use the different methods in both kotlin and java.
