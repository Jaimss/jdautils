#### Name Change
This project used to be called jdautils, but I changed it to kda to represent the fact that it is a kotlin utils package for jda. If you see jdautils anywhere, that is why.

#### Language Support
kda is written in kotlin, and utilizes Kotlin's [extension functions](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/extensions.html) which makes things very easy and quick to do. It adds methods onto things like `MessageChannel` and `MessageAction` to make for awesome oneliners like `someChannel.send("message").cleanup()`. When using java, extension functions can be used as static reciever methods. Please see the wiki for more information on how to use the different methods in both kotlin and java.
